# PyNN-Brette-et-al.-2007
PyNN model of networks of spiking neurons: a review of tools and strategies (Brette et al. 2007)

The main goal is to provide a series of benchmark simulations of networks of spiking neurons, and demonstrate how these are implemented in the different simulators overviewed in the paper.

The results should look like this
